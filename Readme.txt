in this assignment, I used similar topology to the one used in class ( Endian VM, 3 Lubuntu VMs, 1 Kali). The network ID is 10.0.0.0/25.


to run this malware:
1. open GNS3 and start all VMs
2. open kali 
3. navigate to "/home/kali/Desktop"
4. drag and drop the worm.py file in the "/home/kali/Desktop" directory
5. from the terminal, python3 worm.py
